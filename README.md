# Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation-model
### Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) is a process in which particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion, cluster together to form aggregates of such particles.This theory was proposed in 1981 by T.A. Witten Jr. and L.M. Sander and it is used to any system in which the main means of transport is diffusion.
#### The irreversible formation of large clusters from basic subunits is seen often in nature,such as the growth of tumors, coagulation of smoke particles,the early stages of nucleation, electric deposition of ions onto an electrode.These clusters are different from equilibrium irreversible kinetic processes in which the basic units of clusters, after they have joined the clusters, are notable to rearrange themselves.These kinetic aggregation processes were known to result in fractal geometry
##### This concept of fractal geometry was introduced by B. Mandelbrot in order to study the geometrical properties of complex objects. He found that these objects, that could not previously be described by simple means,can be characterized by a few parameters. The volume V (r) has a power-law relations with the linear size of the object : V (r) ' r d where d is the Hausdorff dimension or fractal dimension and is generally not a simple integer.The structure of fractal aggregates looks like that of equilibrium systems near a critical point. Witten and Sander proposed a simple kinetic model of diffusion limited aggregation, helping understand the structure of the aggregates or the clusters formed by irreversible growth processes. Forrest and Witten studied the condensation of smoke particles of iron, zinc and silicon dioxide and found that the particle density correlation of the resulting aggregates can be long-ranged. They also discovered that the aggregates are self-similar in the statistical sense so they are fractals.
